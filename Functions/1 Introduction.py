#Functions:
-A Function is a block of stmts performing particular task

-Functions are not executed automatically

-To execute functions,we need to make a function call

-we can make 'n' no of function falls.

-Functions are executed on demand by making a call.

-All the stmts within the function should follow the indentation

-In Python, a function is defined by using a keyword def

#syntax for defining a function:
def functionname(Arguments):
    '''Document string'''
    stmt1
    stmt2
    stmt3
    stmt4
    return stmt

Document string specifies the functionality of a function i.e what is the function meant for
Specifying Document string is optional

To execute the the above function,we need to make a function call using functionname.
